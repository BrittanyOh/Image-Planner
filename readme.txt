Description:
The Image Planner project is a site used to show my overall understanding of Javascript, HTML and CSS. The site enables users to add, view
and removes images using their url.

Comments:
The site is set up to be view liked a gallery. The overall functionality is pretty smooth except for one minor error. Once a row of images is full, the last
2-3 images tends to glitch when the mouse hovers. Besides that the site's functionality is smooth. If a user enters duplicate images the delete button will
remove the first instance. Lastly, in order to host the site to Github Pages I had to create an index.html file for the server to find and use.
